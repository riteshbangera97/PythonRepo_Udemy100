# find the highest score from list
# Do not use the max function
# Using for loop is compulsury



# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

# e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

# Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

# The highest score in the class is: x


######################## My Answer ########################

Input a list of student scores
student_scores = input("Enter scores with space:- \n").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])

# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡
student_scores.sort()

for i in student_scores:
  i

print(f"The highest score in the class is: {i}")
